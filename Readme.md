# Server-Eye/helpers

The files in this section are Powershell-scripts for Windows to use the API of Server-Eye. Powershell version 3 or newer is mandatory to execute the scripts.

If you don't already have an API-Key then you must create an API-Key with the Script CreateApiKey.ps1 because all other scripts need the API-Key as a parameter.

A lot of the scripts in this section create an Excel-File to visualize the results. Therefore Microsoft Excel must be installed on the system on which the scripts are executed.
